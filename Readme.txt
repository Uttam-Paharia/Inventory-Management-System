This project is a simple implementatioin of Inventory Management System using C++.
In this project, we have a Product class with attributes like id, name, price, and quantity.
We have an Inventory class that stores a list of products and provides methods to add, remove, update products, update quantity, update price, and display all products.
In the main function, we display a menu to the user with options to add, remove, update products, update quantity, update price, and display all products.
The user can choose an option and perform the corresponding operation on the inventory.
The program continues to display the menu until the user chooses to exit.
This project demonstrates the use of classes, objects, vectors, and basic I/O in C++.
